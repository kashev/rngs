There are many ways to test the effectiveness of random number generators. We plan to use several different analysis methods. The first is the series of Diehard tests developed by George Marsaglia \cite{diehard}. These tests can either be reproduced from their descriptions, or used directly. Related to these tests are the Die Harder tests. However, most valuable is a toolkit published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology on the testing of Random Number Generators \cite{nisttoolkit}. This toolkit includes source code, as well as a detailed implementation guide.

The Die Harder suite, as well as the NIST toolkit, support the GNU Scientific Library wrapper for RNGs. Thus, structuring our code within the GSL structures will allow us to use the source to stream the output of our implementations of the RNGs to the existing tests.
