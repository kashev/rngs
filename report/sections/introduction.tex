The applications of randomness are far reaching. From statistics to simulation, there is a large need for random number generators to perform quickly, generate seemingly random numbers, yet be reproducible in case something needs to be random yet reproducible. Thus, the creation of pseudo random number generators, or PRNGs, has become a large research area in modeling and computer simulation. In the field of analysis of computing systems, simulation is an extremely important part of the modeling process. Today's stochastic models become so complex that solving these models analytically becomes impossible. Simulations driven by randomness are common, and motivate the study in this paper.

\textbf{TODO:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Emphasize that here, we mean psuedo random number generators for simulation.
    \item Mention true hardware random number generators.
    \item Mention Crypographic RNGs, and emphasize that this is not that.
    \item Describe the plan for the paper.
\end{itemize}
