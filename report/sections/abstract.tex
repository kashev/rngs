We implement in efficient C++ several kinds of different modern pseudo-random number generators, or PRNGs; a Linear Congruential Generator, a Lagged Fibonacci Generator, an Xorshift type generator, and a Mersenne Twister Generator. We discuss the challenges in testing these kinds of PRNGs, and discuss one of the more common frameworks for testing these random number generators. Finally, we compare our results to what we expect from these implementations, as well as comment on the suitability of these PRNGs for use in simulation of systems.
