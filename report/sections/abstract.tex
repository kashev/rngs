We implement several kinds of different modern pseudo-random number generators, or PRNGs, in C++; Linear Congruential Generators, a Lagged Fibonacci Generator, an Xorshift type generator, a Complementary Multiply with Carry Generator, and two variations of the Mersenne Twister Generator. We discuss the challenges in testing these kinds of PRNGs, and discuss one of the more common frameworks for testing these random number generators. Finally, we compare our results to what we expect from these implementations, as well as comment on the quality and suitability of these PRNGs for use in simulation of systems.
