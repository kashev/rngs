For this project, we use the Dieharder binary on Ubuntu in its raw input mode. This allows us to use a shell pipe to send raw random numbers from an arbitrary generator into Dieharder for analysis.

There are two major components included in our code: C++ source to build an RNG binary, and a small Python script to call the RNG binary and pipe it into Dieharder appropriately. We chose C++ because these tests can take a long time if the generator is slow, and C++ is a good compromise between its ability to allow for modular code and its speed.

The specific RNG algorithms implemented are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mersenne Twister
    \item RANDU
    \item MINSTD
    \item R250
    \item RANLUX
    \item Xorshift
\end{itemize}
Each RNG algorithm inherits from a common base class, which allows for the RNG binary to choose the RNG in use via a command line argument. Random 32 bit numbers are written to \texttt{stdout} in raw binary, which is in turned piped to Dieharder for analysis. Finally, the output of Dieharder can be optionally piped to file.

All code is available on Github \cite{github_repo}.
